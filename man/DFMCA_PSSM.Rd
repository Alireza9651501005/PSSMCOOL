\title{DMACA-PSSM feature}
\usage{
DFMCA_PSSM(pssm_name, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{pssm_name}{name of PSSM Matrix file}

\item{n}{A parameter called the window size that must be smaller than the length of the sequence}
}
\value{
feature vector of length 210
}
\description{
In this feature each column of PSSM Matrix, can be regarded as a time series. Each PSSM
contains 20 columns Hence, each PSSM can be considered as 20 time series.The detrended moving-average
cross-correlation analysis (DMCA) is developed to measure the level of cross-correlation between two
non-stationary time series by fusing the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) and the detrended
moving average(DMA).this function utilises this algorithm for each column and each pair of columns to produce
a feature vector of length 290.

\note{
parameter n must be equal or greater than 3 and equal or less then L which L is length of protein
