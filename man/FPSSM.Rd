\title{D-FPSSM and SF-PSSM feature vectors}
\usage{
FPSSM(pssm_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{pssm_name}{name of PSSM Matrix file}
}
\value{
two feature vectors of different length which is used in later steps.
}
\description{
This function produces list of two feature vectors named D-FPSSM and S-FPSSM
which then used by FPSSM2 function to construct feature vector of length 100 for each pair of
proteins which then used for protein-protein interaction prediction in each dataset.

q<-FPSSM(system.file("extdata","C7GQS7.txt.pssm",package="PSSMCOOL"))
