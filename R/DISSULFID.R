#' disulfid connectivity feature
#' @description This feature is used to predict the disulfide bond within a protein.
#' @param pssm_name name of PSSM Matrix file
#' @import utils
#' @details  For the purpose of predicting disulfide bond in protein at first, the total
#'number of cysteine amino acids in the protein sequence is counted and their position in the protein sequence is
#'identified. Then, using a sliding window with length of 13, moved on the PSSM matrix from top to bottom so that
#'the middle of the window is on the amino acid cysteine, then the rows below the matrix obtained from the PSSM
#'matrix with dimension of 13 x 20 are placed next to each other to get a feature vector with a length of
#'260 = 20 * 13 per cysteine, and if the position of the first and last cysteine in the protein sequence is such
#'that the middle of sliding window is not on cysteine residue when moving on PSSM Matrix, then the required
#'number of zero rows from top and bottom is added to the PSSM matrix to achieve this goal.Thus, for every
#'cystine amino acid presented in protein sequence, a feature vector with a length of 260 is formed.Then all
#'the pairwise combinations of these cysteines is wrote in the first column of a table, and in front of each of these
#'pairwise combinations, the corresponding feature vectors are sticked together to get a feature vector of length 520
#'for each of these compounds.Finally, the table obtained in this way will have the number of rows equal to the
#'number of all pairwise combinations of these cysteines and the number of columns will be equal to 521
#'(the first column includes the name of these pair combinations). And it is easy to divide this table into
#'training and testing data and predict the desired disulfide bonds between cysteines.
#' @return a table with number of all cyctein pairs in rows and 521 columns correspond to feature vector length.
